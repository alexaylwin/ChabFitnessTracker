  <h2> Getting Started </h2>
  <p>
    The 'CHAB Fitness Tracker' is set up to help you calculate your daily point totals, or save and track your workouts by week. To get
    started, just enter your workout on the 'Add Workout' page. You can use this as a calculator for reporting a daily score. 
  </p>
  <h2> Saving and Viewing Workouts </h2>
  <p>
    If you want to save workouts, please see the help icon beside the save button to see how saving works. After you've begun saving workouts, 
    you can see them on the 'View Workouts' page. These will be reported by week (Mon -> Sun) and will show you weekly point totals.
  </p>
  <h2> Point Calculations </h2>
  <p>
    Points are calculated fractionally and rounded down. The simple calculation is: <br />
    <span class='code-font'>floor((points / (count per points)) * count)</span>
    <br />
    So, for example, walking 1.5km: <br />
    <span class='code-font'>floor((10 / 1) * 1.5) = 15 points</span>
    <br />
    Or, doing 7 pull-ups: <br/>
    <span class='code-font'>floor((4 / 5) * 7) = 5 points</span>
  </p>
